Now, let start with new ideas

## Project Overview
In This project we will analyzes movie data that will help us to take three different decisions to helped Microsoft with its journey to creating a new movie studio. To create any movie genres is the one of the most important part, Genres are categories for films, in other world you can say- is a combination of two genres like Comedy-Romantic, Sci-fi, ect. This analysis of the movie industry allowed me to make an informed decision about what kind of content we use for more views and TRP. What Microsoft should strive for when comparing their budget to their global gross. The runtime for each of Microsoft's movies, and finally. Microsoft can make the most of our well-informed choices to increase the likelihood that a movie will be a success. 

### Business Problem

Microsoft is one of the big company who used to creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. Now the situation is that they want to lunch a new movie studio, but they don’t know about content that creater use to creating movies. This analysis aims to help Microsoft make infromed decisions about how they should approach this new venture.

### Some of the Questions for help to slove this business problem: -

What kind of genre we using for movie

What their desired domestic gross should be when they develop their production budget

What a movie's ideal runtime should be

## Gatting data from

The data being used for this project comes from the imdb.title.basics, imdb.title.rating, bom.movie_gross, which in zippeddata. This data was provided to us through the movies database like Movie_title, studio_name, domeomestic_gross,	foreign_gross, year, genres, averagerating, Original_title,	runtime_minutes and so on. In order to convey the strategy we think Microsoft should take in order to have the best chance of success in their new conflict between giants like Disney and Netflix, we used this data to develop innovative visuals that are both effective and unique.

### The methode we use

We used the movie data that was provided to us and a variety of information relevent to our proposal. After cleaning up the data, we used seaborn and matplotlib to produce visualisations, and come up with some solution that are help Microsoft to take the decisions and simple to understand.

## Let's understand the visualisations  

The graph belows shoes top five types of the genres like Romance, documentary, Drama, Action,adventure,fantasy, mystery,thriller, or are all above gives information about of the Averagerating..

The graph belows shows the combination of the averagerationg and nomber of averageration. We clearly understand that very few kind of genres, which people like to watch.

Most movies make anywhere for 0 to 182500000  dollars for their worldwide gross.

Lastly we can see from the below two graph what the average foreign gross is for movies released in each year.

the graph below showa the average running time of all the films in our data collection is 90 minutes, with the majority of them falling between 80 and 110 minutes.
This explains the graph above in greater depth and demonstrates just how many genres have average runtimes that are longer than 97 minutes.

## Conclusion
The analysis yields three suggestions.
1) Microsoft should produce either a Documentary, Romance, or mystery movie and release it in either June or November.
2) They should analyze the plot to set an universal gross objective that is associated to Microsoft's production budget based on the company's production budget.

3)The length of Microsoft's movies should be between 90 and 125 minutes.
